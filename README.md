# Artificial-Intelligence---The-PacMan-Projects
Pacman Artificial Intelligence Python project for UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI

Project 1, Search:

Depth-First Search (DFS): Graph search that avoids expanding already visited states. Fringe implemented via stack.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Graph search that avoids expanding already visited states. Fringe implemented via queue.
Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Graph search that avoids expanding already visited states. Fringe implemented via Priority Queue.
A* Search: uses Manhattan distance heuristic to find optimal solution
CornersProblem: Search problem and heuristic for pacman to reach all active corner dots on board.
FoodSearchProblem: Search problem and heuristic for pacman to eat all active dots on board.
